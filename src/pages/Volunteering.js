          I supported the Jaago Foundation which is a non profit organization in Bangladesh that focuses on the welfare of underprivileged children, where I was responsible for tutoring children in spoken English. This involved developing lesson plans, creating interactive activities, and helping the children build their confidence in speaking and understanding English. I worked with children from different backgrounds, and my role also included providing emotional support to help them overcome educational barriers.
